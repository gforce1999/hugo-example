A video regarding my implentation can be found on my private (channel)[https://youtu.be/h7uEQMHaRPc]:

This is an implementation of a continuous delivery pipeline of a static website.  In this demo, a static web-site generator called "Hugo" was deployed to AWS.   Two services were used on the AWS side:  AWS CodeBuild & S3.   AWS CodeBuild is setup to execute a buildspec.yml  configuration and will automatically deploy any "push" events automatically to the cloud.
